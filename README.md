## 1. Call Center Trends

This Power BI project aims to analyze and visualize key call center metrics to improve customer satisfaction, optimize agent performance, and enhance operational efficiency. The interactive dashboard provides insights into customer interactions, call response times, and agent productivity, enabling data-driven decision-making.

#### **Key Metrics & Insights:**

1.  **Overall Customer Satisfaction**

    -   Analyzes customer feedback scores and call resolution rates.
    -   Displays satisfaction trends over time using KPIs and sentiment analysis.
2.  **Overall Calls Answered vs. Abandoned**

    -   Tracks the total number of calls received, answered, and abandoned.
    -   Identifies patterns in call drop rates and customer service effectiveness.
3.  **Calls by Time**

    -   Provides a time-based analysis of call volumes (hourly, daily, weekly trends).
    -   Helps identify peak hours and staffing needs for efficient workforce management.
4.  **Average Speed of Answer (ASA)**

    -   Measures the time taken to answer incoming calls.
    -   Highlights trends in response efficiency to reduce customer wait times.
5.  **Agent's Performance Quadrant (Average Handle Time vs. Calls Answered)**

    -   Visualizes agent efficiency by comparing **Average Handle Time (AHT)** and the **number of calls answered**.
    -   Categorizes agents into performance quadrants (e.g., High AHT & Low Calls vs. Low AHT & High Calls).
    -   Helps in identifying top-performing agents and those needing training.
